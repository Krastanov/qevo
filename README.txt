Optimized Quantum Entanglement

`qevo.py` provides a small python library for the creation and optimization of
quantum entanglement purification circuits.

`Clifford.jl` is a higly-optimized julia library for enumerating and studying
the Clifford group of multiple qubits.

`examples` contains multiple notebooks showcasing the use of these libraries.
Some of these files were used in the writing of the related paper.

See [qevo.krastanov.org](https://qevo.krastanov.org) for visualizations and
comparisons of circuits generated by this software.
